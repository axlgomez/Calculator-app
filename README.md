# Calculator app

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

Here I have built out this calculator app .

You should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser
